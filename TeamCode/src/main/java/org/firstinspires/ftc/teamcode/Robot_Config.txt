# Drivetrain PID Controller Values
# For a basic drivetrain (with nothing on top) on floor, simple working values are: Ks = 0.05, Kp = 0.001, Ki = 0.0, Kd = 0.0
# Ks is a static term that specifies a minimum power.
# Kp is the proportional term. It is directly proportional to the error (Kp * error). Higher values will result in greater moves towards 0 error.
# Ki is the integral term. It is directly proportional to the sum of all errors (for a finite lookback period). It addresses nonlinear effects (e.g. friction) by allowing cumulative errors to overcome a constant disturbance.
# Kd is the derivative term. It is directly proportional to the rate of change of error. It is multiplied by the difference between the last error and the current error (also divided by time elapsed). It works to dampen changes.
